Created for a project in Dr. Vargas's Computer Architecture course at Georgia
Southern University.

Scan items as you shop at Walmart, and the app will find the best way to split
the items between two people! Add groups of items, items by weight, or just a 
single item. 

Barcode scanning for prices is currently only functional at Walmart in 
Statesboro, GA (stores #754 and #2858), but a store location selector will be
added before the official release.
